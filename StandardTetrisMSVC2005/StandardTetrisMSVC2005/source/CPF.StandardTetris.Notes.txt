Miscellaneous notes relevant to building with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 
Express Edition


Building this application requires installing the following:
  "Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2"


Please see the following web pages regarding installing and 
  using the "Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2":

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/

    http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/FreeVS2005Win32.asp


Here is a portion of the content of the codeproject.com web page
  on the subject:
  
	Without fixing this you will get errors such as not being able 
	to include "windows.h". Start Visual Studio and in the menu under 
	the Projects and Solutions section in the Options dialog box, 
	add the paths to the appropriate subsections:

	Executable files: 
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Bin

	Include files: 
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include

	Library files: 
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Lib

	Be sure to check that these paths are remembered by Visual Studio! 
	Close the view and go back there and make sure it remembers them! 
	Also use Windows explorer to verify these directories as the SDK may 
	have installed to a different directory. The directories may in fact be:

	Executable files: 
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Bin

	Include files: 
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include

	Library files: 
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib

	This is a major stumbling block for many people. Verify the directories 
	before adding them!
	
	
	Default Link Libraries

	Without fixing this you will get unresolved externals link errors about 
	Windows API functions. Close Visual Studio and then edit 
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCProjectDefaults\corewin_express.vsprops 
	
	and change 

	  AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib"

	to

	  AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib"
	    
	    
	Enable Win32 Applications

	Edit the file 
	
	  “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCWizards\AppWiz\Generic\Application\html\1033\AppSettings.htm". 
	  
	Using notepad or any plain text editor, put // in front of the following lines 
	(as well as any other "disabled = true" lines if you want):
  
  
		WIN_APP.disabled = true;
		WIN_APP_LABEL.disabled = true; 
		DLL_APP.disabled = true; 
		DLL_APP_LABEL.disabled = true;
  

I think the instructions on the Microsoft web page and the codeproject.com web
page are a little confusing about how to get to the settings for the following
paths: "Executable files",  "Include files", "Library files".  Getting to these
settings in MSVC2005 involves going through the following sequence of menus:

		 Tools (main menu item)
		 --> Options (drop-down menu option)
		 --> Projects and Solutions (a tree node)
		 --> VC++ Directories (a tree node)
		 --> Show directories for... (a combo-box drop down
		     with the following options, among others)
				 Executable files
				 Include files
				 Library files

Once each item in that combo-box is selected, there is a mechanism for 
adding a path to a list of paths.



Regarding MSVCR80D.DLL; :

MSVCR80D.DLL is at the following location, but I think the manifest of my 
application sometimes neglects to mention this location -- and so my application
doesn't find this DLL all the time when I'm debugging.  It's very mysterious...

  C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS\x86_Microsoft.VC80.DebugCRT_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.42_x-ww_f75eb16c
